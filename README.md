## Using Snippets in Projects

1. Copy the snippet (e.g., ``` product-gallery-slider.liquid ```) to the Shopify theme's ``` snippets```/ folder.
2. Render the snippet in the appropriate section or template:
```bash
{% render 'product-gallery-slider' %}
```
3. Include CSS/JS if applicable (in ```theme.liquid``` or elsewhere):
```bash
{{ 'wasabi-base.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
{{ 'wasabi-utilities.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
```
4. Customize settings if needed (e.g., update class names, color variables, or logic).

## Naming Convention



To keep components organized and easily traceable:
```bash
| Prefix | Meaning                                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ww_`  | Generic Wasabi Web snippet/component             |
| `xx_`  | Client-specific (replace `xx` with initials)     |
```

> **Example:** `ab_custom_product-card.liquid` for client **A&B**


Guidelines for Adding New Snippets

   1.  Create a ```.liquid``` file in the correct ```snippets```/ subfolder.

   2. Add a corresponding ```.md``` file in the ```docs/``` directory with:

       - Purpose/Description

       - Setup instructions

       - Configuration options

       - Example usage

       - (Optional) Screenshot

    Add an inline comment at the top of each .liquid file:

```
{%- comment -%}
Wasabi Web ‚Äî Client: AB ‚Äî Custom Product Card (2025-07-13)
{%- endcomment -%}
```

## Philosophy

We believe in modularity first. Every component should:

  -  Be drop-in ready

   - Avoid tight coupling to theme-specific code

   - Allow basic configuration via schema or props

   - Be documented well enough to reimplement or extend

This approach ensures:

   - Faster dev times across projects

   - Easier onboarding of new team members

   - Safe, isolated updates to snippets

   - Better upgrade paths across themes

## Contributing

All contributions should follow the naming conventions and folder structure.

  -  Fork, branch, commit, PR

  - Use meaningful commit messages

  - Keep snippets short and purposeful
